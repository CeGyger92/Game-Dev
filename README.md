# Game-Dev
Collection of game genre prototypes created with Unity in C#.

Each folder includes the game's C# scripts and a zip folder of the entire Unity project. Demo videos for each prototype can be found here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oNkmw2WcpQYlKhudpZIFiLQZ-noKqHKo?usp=sharing

Bezos Bundle:
The Bezos bundle was created with the idea that creativity thrives under constraints. While creating a prototype for 5 different game types I centered them all around the idea that Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, was a super villian in need of overcoming. All games in this repo are in a prototype stage with a demonstratable main gameplay loop.

1. BetterThanBezos - single button time waster game inspired by Cookie Clicker where you try to become richer than Bezos.

2. Bamboozle Bezos - a puzzle logic game where you must reroute the correct voltage of power to Bezos' PC and fry his CPU.

3. Amazon Avenger - a 2D platformer where you play as the security robot guarding the amazon warehouse from a now ousted Jeff Bezos.

4. No Bail For Bezos - a 2D action game where you protect the police station from waves of Jeff's goons and prevent Bezos from escaping from his cell.

5. Banish Bezos - in this RPG Bezos escapes to a fantasy land where he rises to the status of a high wizard. You must take his power and banish him back from whence he came.

AirGodsArena:
Final game in this repo is a simple Air Hockey simulator with over the top Arena combantant style music and voice-over. This was a step into learning networked multiplayer games.
